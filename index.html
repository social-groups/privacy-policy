        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            The Social Groups app does <strong>not</strong> require users to create an account or provide personal identification details. 
            The only data we collect from users is the <span class="highlight">group link</span> (such as WhatsApp group links, Facebook group links, or Telegram channel links) 
            and <span class="highlight">details related to the group</span>, which users voluntarily upload through the app.
        </p>
        <p>This data is used solely to <strong>make these group links available for other app users</strong> to join.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Our app integrates third-party services that may collect certain information to provide their services. These third-party services comply with 
            their own privacy policies. We encourage users to <span class="highlight">review the privacy policies of these third-party services</span> before using the app:
